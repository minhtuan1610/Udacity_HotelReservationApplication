Application Architecture

1. User interface (UI), including a main menu for the users who want to book a room,
   and an admin menu for administrative functions
2. Resources will act as our Application Programming Interface (API) to our UI
3. Services will communicate with our resources, and each other, to build the business
   logic necessary to provide feedback to our UI
4. Data models will be used to represent the domain that we're using within the system

User Scenarios

- Creating a customer account. The user needs to first create a customer account before they can create a reservation.
- Searching for rooms. The app should allow the user to search for available rooms based on provided checkin and
  checkout dates. If the application has available rooms for the specified date range, a list of the corresponding rooms
  will be displayed to the user for choosing.
- Booking a room. Once the user has chosen a room, the app will allow them to book the room and create a reservation.
- Viewing reservations. After booking a room, the app allows customers to view a list of all their reservations.

Admin Scenarios

- Displaying all customers accounts
- Viewing all the rooms in the hotel
- Viewing all the hotel reservations
- Adding a room to the hotel application

Reserving a Room - Requirements

- Avoid conflicting reservations. A single room may only be reserved by a single customer per check-in and check-out
  date range.
- Search for recommended rooms. If there are no available rooms for the customer's date range, a search will be
  performed that displays recommended rooms on alternative dates. The recommended room search will add seven days to the
  original check-in and check-out dates to see if the hotel has any availabilities and then display the recommended
  rooms/dates to the customer. Example: If the customers date range search is 1/1/2020 â€“ 1/5/2020 and all rooms are
  booked, the system will search again for recommended rooms using the date range 1/8/2020 - 1/12/2020. If there are no
  recommended rooms, the system will not return any rooms.

Room Requirements

- Room cost. Rooms will contain a price per night. When displaying rooms, paid rooms will display the price per night
  and free rooms will display "Free" or have a $0 price.
- Unique room numbers. Each room will have a unique room number, meaning that no two rooms can have the same room
  number.
- Room type. Rooms can be either single occupant or double occupant (Enumeration: SINGLE, DOUBLE).

Customer Requirements

- A unique email for the customer. RegEx is used to check that the email is in the correct format (i.e.,
  name@domain.com(opens in a new tab)).
- A first name and last name.
